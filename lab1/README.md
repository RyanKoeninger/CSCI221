## PYTHON_LIB HOMEWORK
This isn't a real homework, but it's an example of how to write a README if your python built-in functions were a homework assignment.

To compile this code, run the following command:

```gcc python_lib.c test.c -o test```

### 1. power()
- **WHERE**: code for power() is in python_lib.h and python_lib.c
- **HOW**: run power() by inputing an integer b, and an integer e for the base and exponent respectively. For example, power(2,3) should give 8.
- **NOTES**: for some reason the outputs are one exponent too high. That probably means there's something wrong with the for loop, but I didn't have time to fix the bug before the due date.

### 2. abs()
- **WHERE**:
- **HOW**:
- **NOTES**:

### 3. max()
- **WHERE**:
- **HOW**:
- **NOTES**:
